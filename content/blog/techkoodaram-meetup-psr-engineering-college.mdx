# techKoodaram Meetup @ PSR Engineering College

This blog is about **techKoodaram Meetup** conducted at **PSR Engineering College**. I am sharing this in simple words, from my point of view.

---

## Meetup Overview

* **Total Registrations:** 75
* **Total Attendees:** 55

## A Visit Before the Event

Before the meetup, as part of the **techKoodaram organizing team**, we went to **PSR Engineering College** and met the Correspondent **Mr. Solaisamy**.

This moment is very close to my heart ❤️

Even before the event happened, we could feel the **trust and support** from PSREC. Mr. Solaisamy was very clear about one thing — *hospitality comes first*. That mindset itself tells a lot about the institution.

Small note here 📌
**Vijay K P** is missing in that picture because he was travelling to the venue at that time.

Big thanks to **PSR Engineering College (PSREC)** and **Kasi Raman R** for providing the venue and taking care of us so well.

## How the Day Started

The day started with **Sankarvelu’s session**. It helped everyone to settle down and get into the learning mood. A good opening always sets the tone, and this one did.

---

## Session: Inside Large Language Models

Sankar spoke about **“Inside Large Language Models: How They Really Work”**.

He tried to explain topics like:

* Tokenization
* Transformers
* Training and inference
* Why hallucinations happen

He focused more on **basic understanding** rather than complex theory.

One main point he shared was:

> LLMs don’t really understand the world, they only understand language patterns.

Students asked good questions, and the curiosity in the room was very motivating.

## Session: Data Analytics with Power BI

**Nithya** took a session on **Data Analytics using Power BI**.

She explained in a very simple way, especially useful for students. She used a **Chocolate dataset** and showed:

* Donut charts
* Pie charts
* Basic data visuals

It was easy to follow and practical. Many students could clearly understand how Power BI can be used.

## Session: React, Future and AI

**Mahendran** spoke about **React**, how it is used in real applications, and what the future looks like.

He also touched on **open‑source AI** and how it connects with modern web development. The best part was his explanation — very clear and beginner‑friendly.

Even people new to React could understand the basics after his session.
